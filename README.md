# âš¡ CryptoPulse

**CryptoPulse** is a Python utility that monitors the "pulse" of the Ethereum network.  
It measures the number of pending transactions and analyzes the average gas price to indicate the current network state:

- ðŸ”¥ **HIGH** â€” network congestion, mempool exploding.
- ðŸŸ¢ **NORMAL** â€” steady activity.
- ðŸ’¤ **LOW** â€” calm state, transactions go through easily.
